This project contains few sample code for running some machine learning
algorithms using Spark ML.
It is a mavenized project. All regular maven operations can be done for compiling and packaging.

Following is the way it needs to be run,
1. spark-submit --class "org.vivek.spark.ml.SparkDecisionTree" --master local[4] spark-ml-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar > out_dtree.txt
2. spark-submit --class "org.vivek.spark.ml.SparkNaiveBayes" --master local[4] spark-ml-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar > out_nb.txt
3. spark-submit --class "org.vivek.spark.ml.SparkMultinomial" --master local[4] spark-ml-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar > out_mn.txt
4. spark-submit --class "org.vivek.spark.ml.SparkLogit" --master local[4] spark-ml-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar > out_logit.txt

The model csv files are expected to be present in the current directory while running.
Redirecting the output into a file help you looking at the useful information as spark prints lots of information on the console.

Spark needs to be installed and configured before running these commands.
